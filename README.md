In this work, we have a set of 5 cars for which we want to develop classifiers and detectors. Collection of cars on the list now: Iran Khodro Dena and Dena Plus Kia Cerato Mazda 3N and Mazda 3 Peugeot 206 Saipa Saina. This is done voluntarily. To collect data, car sales websites (شیپور) have been used, which have been collected via web crawling.
