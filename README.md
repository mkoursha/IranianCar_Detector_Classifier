# IranianCar_Detector_Classifier
In this work, we have a set of 5 cars for which we want to develop classifiers and detectors. 
Collection of cars on the list now: 
1) Iran Khodro Dena and Dena Plus 
2) Kia Cerato 
3) Mazda 3N and Mazda 3 
4) Peugeot 206 
5) Saipa Saina 

This is done voluntarily. 
To collect data, car sales websites (شیپور) have been used, which have been collected via web crawling.
for classifing bellow algorithms are used :
1) my own CNN network
2) MobileNetV2 pre-trained model
3) YOLO-v4 tiny

we have some conditions on our models :
1) CNN model can't has more than 2M parameters
2) MobileNetV2 model can't has more than 3M parameters
3) YOLO model can't has more than 6M parameters
